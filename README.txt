The dataset contains structural T1-weighted and functional magnetic resonance brain imaging data, from 37 men (aged 20-30), along with questionnaire-assessed measurements of trait-like eveningness, distinctness, sleep quality, personality type, anxiety levels, sensitivity to punishment and rewards, behavioral inhibition and activation system, attention deficits. In this study fMRI version of Monetary Incentive Delay task (MID) was used. The recruitment criteria excluded individuals with self-reported history of psychiatric or neurological conditions and current medication use. All the brain imaging sessions were performed between 1 PM and 5 PM in order to control the effect of time of day on acquired images. To control the seasonal effect, all scans were performed during 2 weeks in summer. The data is mostly useful to scientists interested in circadian rhythmicity. It can be deployed in large-scale multicenter meta-analyses investigating the structural brain correlates of chronotypes in humans. On the other hand, dataset may be used in various studies focused on affective processing.
